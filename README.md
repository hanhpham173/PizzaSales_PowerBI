The dashboard enables users to monitor sales performance, identify top-selling products, evaluate customer preferences, and make data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Project Objective
To build a dynamic and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that presents real-time insights into pizza sales. The goal is to support strategic decision-making by highlighting sales trends, top-performing items, and customer behavior across different time periods and product categories.

🔄 Process
1. Data Preparation
Imported raw transaction data into Power BI

Cleaned and structured data using Power Query Editor

Created relationships across tables (Date, Pizza, Orders, and Customers)

Developed custom columns and DAX measures for KPI tracking and slicing

2. KPI Calculation
Utilized DAX to compute:

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Average Order Value (AOV)

Top-Selling Pizza Types & Categories

Time-Based Metrics (YTD, MTD, Daily Trends)

Sales Growth & Comparisons (YoY, WoW)

3. Visualization Creation
Included a variety of interactive visuals such as:

KPI Cards

Bar & Column Charts

Donut & Pie Charts

Heat Maps (for Time & Day)

Trend Lines for Daily/Monthly Sales

Detailed Transaction Table

4. Dashboard Design
Organized visuals into a clean, visually balanced layout

Added slicers for Date, Pizza Category, Pizza Size, and Order Type

Included interactive tooltips and filter panes for a seamless user experience

🗃️ Data Modeling
Structured the data model with the following key tables:

Orders: Order ID, Date, Pizza ID, Quantity, Total Price

Pizza: Pizza ID, Name, Category (Classic, Veggie, etc.), Size (S/M/L), Price

Date: Full calendar for time-based analysis

Customer (optional): Used for segmentation and retention analysis

📈 Dashboard Highlights
🔢 Sales Metrics
Total Revenue: $834.75K

Total Orders: 21,350

Average Order Value: $39.12

📊 Best Performers
Top Category: Classic

Top Pizza: “The Classic Deluxe”

Top Size: Large (L)

📅 Time Analysis
Monthly Revenue Trends: Seasonal patterns observed

Weekday Performance: Peak on Fridays and weekends

Hourly Heatmap: Lunch (12–2 PM) and dinner (6–9 PM) are most active

💡 Key Insights
Classic pizzas and large sizes are dominant in sales

Sales spike during lunch and dinner hours, especially on weekends

A small set of pizzas contribute a large share of the revenue (Pareto trend)

Average order value (AOV) remains steady but could be improved through upselling

Specific times of the week (e.g., Monday mornings) show consistently low performance

📌 Business Recommendations
Promote Best Sellers
Use targeted ads and combo deals to promote top-performing pizzas like “The Classic Deluxe” and other Classic category items.

Boost Average Order Value
Introduce limited-time upsell combos (e.g., upgrade to large size + drink/dessert) to increase AOV.

Optimize Staffing & Inventory
Align kitchen and delivery staffing with peak hours and days (e.g., Friday evenings, weekends). Prepare inventory ahead of peak periods.

Drive Off-Peak Sales
Offer weekday promotions or loyalty rewards to stimulate demand during typically slower times like Monday–Wednesday mornings.

Menu Rationalization
Analyze low-selling SKUs and consider revising or removing underperforming pizzas to streamline operations and reduce waste.

Segmented Marketing
Leverage order history (if available) to send personalized offers based on customer preferences, e.g., veggie lovers, large size buyers, etc.

Bundle Strategy
Combine popular pizzas with low-selling ones to increase visibility and clear slow-moving stock while maintaining perceived value.

Seasonal Campaigns
Create seasonal specials or LTOs (limited-time offers) aligned with high-traffic periods like holidays, sports events, or summer vacations.
